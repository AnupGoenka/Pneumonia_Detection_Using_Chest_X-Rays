# Pneumonia_Detection_Using_Chest_X-Rays
This Pneumonia Detector uses Chest X-ray images to classify if a patient has Pneumonia or not.

This uses the dataset from Kaggle - 

https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia 

This project is an example on how to use transfer learning with our own Convolutional neural network. We are extending InceptionV3 model by adding our own layers to predict the X-Ray images containing Pneumonia. We can run in Kaggle workbook with GPU enabled.

Classification models used in this datasets are Transfer Learning, CNN, Tensorflow Neural Network.
