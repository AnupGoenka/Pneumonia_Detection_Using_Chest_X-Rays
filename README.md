# Pneumonia_Detection_Using_Chest_X-Rays
This Pneumonia Detector uses Chest X-ray images to classify if a patient has Pneumonia or not using TensorFlow.

This uses the dataset from Kaggle -

This project is an example on how to use transfer learning with our own Convolutional neural network. We are extending InceptionV3 model by adding our own layers to predict the X-Ray images containing Pneumonia. 

Classification models used in this datasets are Transfer Learning, CNN, Tensorflow Neural Network.
